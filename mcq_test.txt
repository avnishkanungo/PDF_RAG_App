Question 1:
What type of wave is sound?
A. Transverse wave
B. Longitudinal wave
C. Mechanical wave
D. Electromagnetic wave

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Sound waves propagate as a series of compressions and rarefactions in the medium, which is characteristic of longitudinal waves.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 2:
What determines the pitch of a sound?
A. Amplitude
B. Frequency
C. Speed
D. Time period

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The faster the vibration of the source, the higher is the frequency and the higher is the pitch.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 3:
What is the unit of measurement for frequency?
A. Hertz (Hz)
B. Second (s)
C. Meter (m)
D. Kilogram (kg)

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The SI unit of frequency is hertz, denoted by the symbol Hz.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 4:
What is the time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point called?
A. Time period
B. Frequency
C. Speed
D. Amplitude

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The time taken for one complete oscillation is called the time period of the sound wave.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 5:
What determines the loudness or softness of a sound?
A. Frequency
B. Amplitude
C. Speed
D. Time period

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 6:
What type of wave does light represent?
A. Transverse wave
B. Longitudinal wave
C. Mechanical wave
D. Electromagnetic wave

Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Light is a transverse wave, but it's not a mechanical wave as it doesn't involve the oscillation of particles or pressure changes in the medium.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 7:
What is the relationship between frequency and time period?
A. Frequency = Time period
B. Frequency × Time period = 1
C. Frequency / Time period = Speed
D. Frequency + Time period = Amplitude

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point is called the time period, and it's related to frequency as Frequency / Time period = Speed.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 8:
What can be represented graphically in Fig. 11.6(c)?
A. Amplitude of the wave
B. Frequency of the sound wave
C. Density and pressure changes when the sound wave moves in the medium
D. Speed of the sound wave

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The graphical representation shows how density and pressure change when the sound wave moves in the medium.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 9:
What is the term for the loudness or softness of a sound?
A. Pitch
B. Amplitude
C. Frequency
D. Loudness

Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The term for the loudness or softness of a sound is 'loudness', and it's determined basically by its amplitude.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 10:
What is represented by the symbol ν (Greek letter , nu) in Fig. 11.7?
A. Speed
B. Frequency
C. Time period
D. Amplitude

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The symbol ν represents the frequency of the sound wave, denoted by the Greek letter nu.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 11:
What is an example of a transverse wave?
A. Sound wave in a medium
B. Light wave in air
C. Wave on water surface after dropping a pebble
D. Longitudinal wave in a slinky

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The waves you see on the water surface after dropping a pebble is an example of a transverse wave.
