# PDF_RAG_App

## Introduction:
The appliaction here is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to answer quesions on the basis of a document. The application also has automatically triggered agents that can help to take notes and if needed also generate a set of multiple choice questions based on the content of the document.

In addition we are utilizing LLMs installed locally using the Ollama registery, which will need to run on our machine's background for us to utilize the same.
